Delivering products into the hands of the consumer in a timely manner is our number one priority, usually aiming for delivery within 30 minutes. In addition, our entire supply chain consists of vendors licensed to fulfill deliveries on behalf of our API clients to end-users, the consumers."

DASH leverages standard HTTP protocol and can be easily deployed on existing Internet infrastructure (web servers, CDNs, firewalls, etc). \r\n\r\nCommon Encryption (CENC) \r\nCENC is an industry standards based approach to content encryption. CENC identifies standard encryption and key mapping mechanisms that may be utilized by one or more DRM systems to allow the decryption of the same file using different DRM systems. CENC enables content providers to encrypt their content once and deliver it to numerous client devices and their assorted DRM schemes. \r\n\r\nEncrypted Media Extensions (EME) \r\nEME is a proposed W3C standard that provides a set of common APIs that can be used to interact with DRM systems and manage license key exchange. EME allows content providers to design a single application solution for all devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey benefits of Widevine's DRM solution:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport for reliable content protection across multiple systems:. \r\nProvides ubiquitous device coverage and extends synergy across multiple content protection systems.

This helps you in estimating the RUL for various assets such as:\r\n  -  vehicles in motion, based on the sensors attached to the vehicles to various key parts\r\n  -  stationary machinery in manufacturing plants \r\n  -  individual components inside machines etc.\r\n\r\nWhen you do not have the previous failure records or maintenance records available, or if your machinery is brand new with provisions to capture the required data using sensors, this API is the best option for high accuracy predictions.\r\n\r\nThe *Historic Failure Rate API* allows you estimate the asset failure risks for a population of assets based on the maintenance records and previous failure patterns. This helps when you do not have provision to attach sensors and have adequate history of maintenance records for a population of machinery.\r\n\r\n[Get in touch](http://Cenacle.website/#contact) with us if you are interested in utilizing our Predictive Maintenance API in your applications."

This is typically used when the facial photo is captured off angle and a zero-corrected fully frontal image (0 degrees pitch, yaw, and roll) is required.\r\n\r\nDetected facial features may be corrected or modified to improve the final results of subsequent steps.
